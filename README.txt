# MordPerks

This plugin is a test plugin made by billbominecraft for Mordonia
The purpose of this plugin is to condense rank items into a command
and have items be easily editable from the config file.

This plugin, while functions, is still a work in progress that doesn't
quite have everything in it. I'm still a beginner developer who's learning
how to code and do things as I go.
